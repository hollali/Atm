# ATM Mini Project

## Description
This is a simple ATM (Automated Teller Machine) mini-project implemented in C++. It provides basic functionality such as checking balance, cash withdrawal, retrieving user details, and updating the mobile number associated with an account.

## Code Overview
- The code defines a class named `atm`, which encapsulates the functionality of an ATM.
- The class has private member variables for account number, name, PIN, balance, and mobile number.
- It includes setter methods (`setData`) to set the user's account information and getter methods (`getName` and `getPIN`) to retrieve user data.
- The program uses C++'s standard libraries for input and output.

## Usage
1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
   ```bash
   g++ atm.cpp -o atm
